##Premise of game

Game is played with 2 players. Left and Right side. At the beginning of the game, both players get a word(same  word) and are prompted to press a button to start guessing the word. The goal is to guess the fastest. Players will take turns guessing where 1 player starts guessing. The more incorrect guesses are made, the shorter the paddle is upon starting.  After a player guesses incorrectly, the other player takes a turn guessing( the same word). This goes on until one player finishes guessing. Afterwards, you use the paddle to try to attack the opposing player’s heart(lives) by bouncing a ball back and forth, if the ball gets past the opposing player's pong and hits the heart, players will go back into guessing. Paddles will remain the same size and will get even smaller the more wrong guesses there are. Players will move with arrow keys and “W” and “S” keys.
